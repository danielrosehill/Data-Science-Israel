# Data Science Israel: A Resource List

### Project

I'm currently working on a data-related project. As I check out tools, I noticed that some are also based in Israel üáÆüá± ‚ù§Ô∏è.

In the interest of helping the data community find one another, job-seekers find jobs, and ... just by way of FYI ... I decided to create this little repo.

Note: data is a big space that's moving fast. Not only will this list probably be very incomplete at initiation, it will likely remain that way indefinitely.

If you know of cool companies/startups/projects/people that I missed, please either open a pull request or drop me a line by email (me@danielrosehill.com).

On my to-do list (I might nest it under this repo): an English-Hebrew data dictionary to complement by general purpose English-Hebrew tech dictionary.

Thanks for checking it out!

# Data Related Startups, Companies

# Online Data Science Communities

- There are lots and *lots* of online communities for the data world in Israel (like ... really lots). 

- The vast majority (infact, unless otherwise stated) are in Hebrew.
- For (real life) meetup communities, unless otherwise noted, it can be assumed that (like most things in the high-tech world in Israel) they are centered around the Tel Aviv metropolitan area

## Notes: Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria

I excluded a few communities from the following list just because it's already so big or ‚Äî although they look valuable ‚Äî they're focusing on a very small niche or subset of a niche.

Or, conversely, because they were a little too general. For example, there are lots of groups for Python and Python jobs (although of course, these aren't always data-specific)

# Entities To Add

There's a high chance I'll never get around to these, but they would make this resource much more complete. Feel free to open a PR to add them in!

- Data "influencers" / commentators
- Data conferences and events
- Industry associations
- Academic programs
- Incubators
- Open source projects (as many commercial projects also have community editions, I may just duplicate the list)
- Section for AI and ML as it's such a big focus
